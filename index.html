                    <p>Autism is a developmental disorder that affects individuals differently. It emerges in early childhood and can impact social interaction, communication, and behavior. Sensory sensitivities are common. Autism is a spectrum disorder, meaning it varies in severity. Early intervention and support are crucial. Autism is not a disease, and there is no cure, but with the right support, individuals with autism can lead fulfilling lives. Autism doesn't discriminate, and each person is unique, with their own strengths and challenges. Understanding and accepting individuals with autism promotes inclusivity and their well-being.</p>

                    <p>Social Interaction Challenges: People with autism often face difficulties in social interactions. They may struggle with making eye contact, understanding non-verbal cues (such as facial expressions or body language), and developing and maintaining relationships. They may also have difficulty initiating or sustaining conversations.</p>
                    <p>Communication Difficulties: Both verbal and non-verbal communication can be affected in individuals with autism. Some individuals may have delayed or limited speech, while others may have fluent speech but struggle with understanding and using language appropriately. They may have a literal understanding of language, difficulty with sarcasm or humor, or repetitive and echolalic speech (repeating words or phrases).</p>
                    <p>Repetitive Behaviors and Restricted Interests: Many individuals with autism engage in repetitive behaviors or routines. These behaviors can include repetitive movements (such as hand-flapping or rocking), adherence to strict routines, and a strong preference for sameness. They may also develop intense and specific interests in particular topics, objects, or activities.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
                    <p>
                        With the keyword var. For example,<br>
                        <code>var x = 42.</code><br>
                        This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By simply assigning it a value. For example,<br>
                        <code>x = 42.</code><br>
                        This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With the keyword let. For example,<br>
                        <code>let y = 13.</code><br>
                        This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.
                    </p>

            <section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">
                <header>Variable scope</header>
                <article>
                    <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.</p>
                    <p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.</p>
                    <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
                    <p>This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.</p>
                    <code>if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined</code>

                    <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.</p>
                    <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
                    <p>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.</p>
                    <p>The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.</p>
                    <p>You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For example:</p>
                    <code>
                        // THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS
                        WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g;
                        //statements }
                    </code>
                    <p>However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems.</p>
                    <code>
                        const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key =
                        "otherValue";
                    </code>

                <article>
                    <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Six data types that are primitives:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                                <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
                                <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
                                <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                                <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                                <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>and Object.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your application can perform.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:</p>
                    <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
                    <p>condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise, statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement, including further nested if statements.</p>
                    <p>You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested in sequence, as follows:</p>
                    <code>
                        if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) {
                        statement_2; } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else {
                        statement_last; }
                    </code>
                    <p>In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In general, it's good practice to always use block statements, especially when nesting if statements:</p>
                    <code>
                        if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
                        statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
                        statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
                        statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }
                    </code>
                    <p>It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression, because the assignment can be confused with equality when glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:</p>
                    <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code>
                    <p>If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:</p>
                    <code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code>

                    <p>
                        A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:<br>
                        <code>while (condition) statement</code><br>
                        If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.
                    </p>
                    <p>The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and control is passed to the statement following while.</p>
                    <p>
                        To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements.<br>
                        For example, The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:<br>
                        <code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n < 3) { n++; x += n; }</code>
                    </p>
                    <p>With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x. Therefore, x and n take on the following values:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
                        <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
                        <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>After completing the third pass, the condition n < 3 is no longer true, so the loop terminates.</p>
