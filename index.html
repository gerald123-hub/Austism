                    <p>Autism is a developmental disorder that affects individuals differently. It emerges in early
                        childhood and can impact social interaction, communication, and behavior. Sensory sensitivities
                        are common. Autism is a spectrum disorder, meaning it varies in severity. Early intervention and
                        support are crucial. Autism is not a disease, and there is no cure, but with the right support,
                        individuals with autism can lead fulfilling lives. Autism doesn't discriminate, and each person
                        is unique, with their own strengths and challenges. Understanding and accepting individuals with
                        autism promotes inclusivity and their well-being.</p>

                        <li>Each person with autism is unique, and their strengths and challenges may vary</li>

                            autism can lead fulfilling lives.</li>

                <article>
                    <p>Social Interaction Challenges: People with autism often face difficulties in social interactions.
                        They may struggle with making eye contact, understanding non-verbal cues (such as facial
                        expressions or body language), and developing and maintaining relationships. They may also have
                        difficulty initiating or sustaining conversations.</p>
                    <p>Communication Difficulties: Both verbal and non-verbal communication can be affected in
                        individuals with autism. Some individuals may have delayed or limited speech, while others may
                        have fluent speech but struggle with understanding and using language appropriately. They may
                        have a literal understanding of language, difficulty with sarcasm or humor, or repetitive and
                        echolalic speech (repeating words or phrases).</p>
                    <p>Repetitive Behaviors and Restricted Interests: Many individuals with autism engage in repetitive
                        behaviors or routines. These behaviors can include repetitive movements (such as hand-flapping
                        or rocking), adherence to strict routines, and a strong preference for sameness. They may also
                        develop intense and specific interests in particular topics, objects, or activities.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>Spectrum: Autism is often referred to as a spectrum disorder because it encompasses a wide range
                        of symptoms and abilities. Each person with autism has their unique strengths and challenges.
                    </p>
                    <p>Some individuals may require more support and assistance, while others may be highly functional
                        and have exceptional abilities in specific areas.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The autism spectrum refers to the wide range of characteristics and abilities that
                            individuals with autism can have. It recognizes that autism is not a one-size-fits-all
                            condition but rather a spectrum with great variability. Here are some key points about the
                            autism spectrum:
                            <ul>
                                <li>1. Autism Severity Levels: In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
                                    Disorders (DSM-5), autism severity is categorized into three levels based on the
                                    level of support required. Level 1 indicates requiring some support, Level 2
                                    indicates requiring substantial support, and Level 3 indicates requiring very
                                    substantial support.</li>
                                <li>2. Individual Differences: Each person with autism has their unique strengths,
                                    challenges, and needs. Some individuals may have exceptional abilities or talents in
                                    areas like music, art, mathematics, or memory, often referred to as "savant skills."
                                    Others may face significant challenges in multiple areas of functioning.</li>
                                <li>3. Co-occurring Conditions: Individuals with autism may also have co-occurring
                                    conditions or disorders such as intellectual disabilities,
                                    attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety disorders, epilepsy, or
                                    sensory processing difficulties. It's important to consider these additional factors
                                    when understanding and supporting individuals on the autism spectrum.</li>
                                <li>4. Lifespan Perspective: Autism is a lifelong condition. While symptoms may change
                                    and individuals may develop coping strategies over time, autism continues to be a
                                    part of a person's identity throughout their life. Providing appropriate support and
                                    accommodations across the lifespan is crucial for their well-being and success</li>
                                <li>5. It's important to remember that autism is highly individualized, and each
                                    person's experiences and abilities may differ. Understanding the unique
                                    characteristics and needs of individuals on the autism spectrum is key to promoting
                                    inclusivity and support.</li>

                        improve the quality of life for individuals with autism. Treatment approaches may include
                        behavioral therapies, speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, social skills training,
                        and educational support tailored to the individual's needs.</p>
